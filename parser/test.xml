It is the Manchester restaurant that footballers love. 
Former United boss Louis van Gaal swore by it, Mario Balotelli used to get food delivered to his Liverpool home from it and new City goalkeeper Claudio Bravo became the latest of dozens to be pictured outside its now-famous dark windows ahead of his £17m move from Barcelona. 
So what is it about Wing&apos;s?

  Next Claudio Bravo dines at Wing&apos;s as his move to Manchester City... Mario Balotelli pictured leaving Wing&apos;s restaurant in... Louis van Gaal enjoys four-hour last supper at Wing&apos;s after... Pep Guardiola heads out in Manchester after his first...   That was the question my sportsdesk asked and, never one to miss an opportunity, I told them I would have to go and try it out if they wanted a proper answer. 
The Wing&apos;s experience started with the phone call to make the reservation, answered by none other than the man himself who was courteous, friendly and said he would look forward to seeing us at 8pm. 
Wing&apos;s is in Lincoln Square – a quiet slice of city centre tranquillity just off the bars and shops of Deansgate. 
In the middle stands a statue of Abraham Lincoln which commemorates support for the abolition of slavery by Lancashire cotton workers during the Civil War. The statute was bound for Liverpool until resourceful Mancunians got wind and paid for it to come here instead. Some rivalries stand the test of time. 
The imposing 16th president of the United States, however, is rapidly becoming only the second most-popular attraction in his own square.

First impressions are not great. Wing&apos;s sits on the ground floor corner of an unattractive 1960s office/retail block. A Greggs features in the same building and those dark windows offer little glimpse of why the likes of the Class of &apos;92 swear by it. 
Once through the doors, Wing is there to greet us as he is with all his customers. There is an immediate warmth and a handshake as we are shown to our table.

A few words on Wing Shing Chu, whose own tale is worthy of its own story. A native of Hong Kong, he moved to these shores as a teenager in 1979 to study and was immediately sent to work in a relative&apos;s chippy in one of the less salubrious parts of Salford where you will not find many footballers. 
His introduction to the English language came from his aunt deciphering orders from hungry customers and he learned – literally – on his feet. 
It was a far cry from the fine dining he serves today – mopping floors and dishing out fish, chips and peas to legions of workers, starving after long shifts in the factories and on the building sites. 
After training as a dim sum chef and another spell in a chippy, this time in a rough-and-tumble working-class suburb of Oldham, Wing eventually realised his dream by opening his first restaurant in Cheadle Hulme, on the outskirts of Stockport. There, he counted former United centre-back Jaap Stam as one of his regulars. 
Word spread, and the relentlessly hard-working United fanatic, who can name the starting XI from the 1979 FA Cup Final, began to be noticed. 
Twelve years ago he opened the restaurant that has now graced dozens of back pages. Sir Alex Ferguson became a regular. In fact, when United signed China international Dong Fangzhou, Wing was brought in to translate. On one occasion he was welcomed onto the team bus and on another, he travelled with City when Sun Jihai arrived. 
Players followed Ferguson&apos;s lead and its popularity soon crossed the divide, with City stars and visiting clubs to Manchester making a beeline. Blackburn Rovers even held a Christmas Party there.

That outside appearance, you see, is deceptive. Inside it is smart if not posh. There are 15 tables for a reason. Any more and the place risks losing its intimacy. We sat in a booth, which offers privacy but not seclusion. The white-gloved staff are attentive and wheel the delicious food to the table before answering any questions. 
Nobody is looking at each other, the food is not going to win any beauty contests and there is no three-month waiting list. 
Wayne Rooney, who filmed a Chinese New Year message from here, has his own favourite table as does Fred Done, the Salford millionaire bookmaker behind Betfred. 
Everywhere, there are plates signed by happy, high-profile customers. Sharon Osborne, The Killers, Damien Hirst, the list goes on. Van Gaal&apos;s takes pride of place at the entrance. &apos;Relationship is a matter of process,&apos; the Dutchman writes, &apos;but your Chinese food was from the beginning fantastic!&apos; 
United fans may now question Van Gaal&apos;s judgement, but he is not wrong here. 
First the starters: the fillet steak rolls in black pepper sauce were a cylinder of joy, with the chicken cakes in Tom Yum sauce a zesty promise of good things to come. For mains, the sizzling king prawns in Szechaun sauce were bold, meaty and delicious while the moreish, tangy fried steak in Cantonese sauce could have been served in a bucket and there would not have been a crumb left.

It is not pretentious, or fancy, but it is tasty and, including drinks and dessert, there is change from £100. 
The food, however, is not the only reason for the superstar love. Somewhere in the middle of Chinese heaven, I get a text from my mate Martin, a fireman in central Manchester, asking me what I am up to. When I tell him where I am he responds: &apos;Tell Wing &apos;the gaffer&apos; will be in later this week.&apos; 
You see It does not matter if you are a fireman or a footballer the reception will be the same - you will feel looked after. 
And then there is the discretion. Wing politely declined to be interviewed for this piece, as he always does. He gets requests from around the world on an almost daily basis, or, more accurately, every time a footballer is pictured leaving the restaurant. 
Mario Balotelli was a big fan of the food at Wing&apos;s during his time with City and Liverpool

He could write his own book, and would no-doubt be a reporter&apos;s dream contact, but he knows that what goes on in Wing&apos;s stays in Wing&apos;s and that confidentiality is part of the attraction for a certain type of customer. 
Privately, Wing was said to be mortified when he was spotted leaving the Lowry Hotel recently after delivering to Paul Pogba. 
World football&apos;s most expensive player has not forgotten how he was treated when he first showed up for some Chinese food as a hopeful youth teamer nobody had heard of, just like Martin the fireman (who goes back every month) hasn&apos;t. 
Other restaurant owners in the city will be envious of the publicity. For Wing it is a constant worry. Privately he does not want to be seen as cashing in on his famous punters and gets nervous with every paparazzi shot. 
So what, then, is it about Wing&apos;s? The answer, after all of that, is pretty simple. It&apos;s just good.
